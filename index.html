        <h3>Pain itself is something to be loved and pursued, but sometimes circumstances occur in which toil and pain can bring great pleasure. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.

Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain simply because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can bring about some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, who among us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise except to obtain some advantage from it?

But who has any right to find fault with a person who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resulting pleasure?</h3>
